final project for class


This is a quite simple program to help run the Ideal Gas Law (PV=nRT)

The way that it is structured is to solve for the pressure of a 1 or 10 cubic meter container, that contains one mole of a ideal gas.
The main variable is the Temperature (in Kelvin), set up as a sliding scale between 0 degrees and 100. 

To excecute the program, you simply pick your temperature via sliding the bottom slide, deciding between 1 and 10 cubic meters via the two toggle buttons on the top left of the
pop-out, and then finally deciding what unit you would like your final pressure in through the three radio buttons on the top right. Once you have made your selections, you then
need to press the "calculate pressure" button at the bottom of the pop-out. You may have to press it a few times, and re-press the temperature slider to make sure that it 
recognizes the selection, but once you have done that, it is ready to rock and roll.
